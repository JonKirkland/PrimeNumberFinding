# PrimeNumberFinding
 Sieve of Eratosthenes implemented threaded/non-threaded

SieveOfEratosThenes.cpp shows an implementation of the algorithm non-threaded.

SieveThreaded.cpp shows an attempt at threading the algorithm by seperating N numbers into chunks.

SieveSomeOneElses.cpp is code from: https://iq.opengenus.org/multi-thread-cpp-find-all-prime-numbers/ which has been modified by me to only use 5 threads.

See Results.txt for results.

And I realize now I spelt "Eratosthenes" Eratosthemes in some parts of the code/results
