primes fround from 2-100,000 and written to text file without threading:

primes fround from 2-100,000 and written to text file using threads using code from https://iq.opengenus.org/multi-thread-cpp-find-all-prime-numbers/
Time of 193.013ms
The code taken from opengenus.org uses sqrt(N) - 2 number of threads, this is way to many (314 threads) and probably isnt using this many but instead maxing out the amount.
Modifying this code to only use 5 threads with N = 100,000 :
86.19 ms
My threaded code for N=100,000 and 5 threads gives: 
237.1 ms

I tried to use threading to divide N into chunks, but this is less effective as the algorithm thrives on fact that it takes multiples of previous
numbers to eliminate future numbers, the algorithm is inherently sequential.

The code privided from opengenus instead uses threads to eliminate numbers, not attempting to do the whole algorithm in parrarel.
